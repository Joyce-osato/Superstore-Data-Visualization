# Superstore-Data-Visualization
The PowerBI tool is a data analytic tool used for visualization and display of analyzed data. 
In this analysis, it was used to visualize and display the dataset of a Superstore and the relationship with sales, profit, order and other variables

## Data Source

The data was sent to the PSP Analytics whatsapp group by our facilitator Joseph Elijah

## Data Processing
The columns of Sales, Profit, and Discount Columns were formatted to display as currency values under the column tools

The Standard class ship mode is observed to be used to deliver the more quantity of goods while fewer quantity of goods were delivered Same day.

## RECOMMENDATIONS
From the data presented, the sales margin in the south which shows to be lower proves that there should be attention directed to the south to increase the awareness of the products and hence, the sales.

## CONCLUSION
The analysis from the Superstore dataset using the Power BI visualization tool shows the profit margins from various segments, region and the year. We were also able to analyze the regions with the largest and lowest sales and the mode of delivery that delivered the highest quantity.
